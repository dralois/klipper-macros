# klipper-macros
A collection of g-code macros for use with Klipper on.
Most macros should be re-useable for any 3d printer running klipper but it's best to check for compatibility.

Added in printer.cfg using:

```
[include klipper-macros/print/*.cfg]
[include klipper-macros/mappings/*.cfg]
[include klipper-macros/misc/dryer.cfg]
[include klipper-macros/calibration/*.cfg]
```
